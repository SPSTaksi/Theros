The central conflict in Theros is among gods, striving against each other over the devotion of mortals. Mortal devotion equated to divine power: when people fervently pray to a god, when they piously observe the god's rites and sacrifices, and when they devoutly trust in the god's divine might, the god becomes more powerful. 

The competition for mortal devotion isn't necessarily a zero-sum game. The people of Theros don't believe in one particular god to the exclusion of others, and the most pious people pray to all gods with equal fervor.

But a deity's goal is to increase the number of people who, when faced with peril, will call on that god for help. It's that trust, that reliance, that faith that gives the gods their power, not merely ideas and concepts.

Mortal beings (heroes and monsters alike) often become unwitting pawns in the contests of the gods. Having a powerful champion is an indication of a god's power, and can potentially increase the god's own power. A champion who acts as an agent of a god among other people helps increase those people's devotion to the god. And if a hero should happen to strike down the agents of rival god along the way, all the better.
