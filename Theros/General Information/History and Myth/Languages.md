Theros not the most cosmopolitan of worlds, and a relatively small number of languages are used in its lands and sea. The citizens of the three human poleis (Meletis, Akros and Setessa) speak their own dialects of the Common language, mutually intelligible but just different enough to identify the speaker's native land.
Leonin and Minotaurs have their own languages, and tritons speak the Aquan dialect of Primordial. Centaurs and satyrs speak distinct dialect of Sylvan, and different bands of centaurs even pronounce the same words differently. 
Giants and cyclopes share one language. Dragons and sphinxes have a distinct languages rarely spoken among mortals of Theros, and the gods themselves speak in a unique language that few beyond mortal oracles can understand.
