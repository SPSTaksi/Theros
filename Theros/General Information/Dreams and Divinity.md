Theros possesses a unique metaphysical property: things believed and dreamed here eventually become real. The collective unconsciousness of mortal people has the literal power of creation, though this process unfolds over the course of countless centuries. Thus, the gods of Theros and their servants were believed, dreamed and narrated into existence, materializing and becoming fully real as a result of mortal belief in their power.

Once a dream or belief in Theros becomes reality, it is just as real as any other thing, so the gods have been real for a very long time. The people of Theros believe them to be divine, ageless, and all-powerful, and therefore they are.

A single individual can't do anything to make the gods less real or change the nature of a god. It's the collective unconscious of every sapient being on Theros that shapes reality, and changes to that reality occur on the scale of ages, not moments.

In practical terms, then, the gods of Theros are no less real, powerful, or important to Theros than the gods of other worlds are to those worlds. Notably, though, these gods have influence only over Theros and the two planes connected to it: Nyx, the starry realm of the gods, and the Underworld, eventual home of all die.
